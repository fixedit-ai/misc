# misc
Misc scripts and tools that might be useful for AXIS ACAP developers.

The scripts in this repo are for prototyping and inspiration only. The scripts are not maintained, they are not peer-reviewed and they might contain bugs or consist of bad programming patters, this should not be seen as a reflection of the code we create for important or production projects. This repository is created only based on the assumption that sharing something is better than sharing nothing. Please look at our other repositories for maintained, well-tested code and examples.
